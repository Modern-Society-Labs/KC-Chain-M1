## Overview

This MVP memory bank documents the **first implementation step** in our path to the full [Cartesi integration architecture](https://github.com/Modern-Society-Labs/lcore-node). The MVP has been successfully built, tested, and validated, proving the core dual-encryption and on-chain commitment pipeline.

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Strategy: Phase 1 Complete

### **Phase 1: MVP Implementation (Status: âœ… Complete - Milestone 1)**
- **Standalone Dual Encryption**: The `encryption` crate successfully implements a two-stage AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 pipeline.
- **Local SQLite Storage**: The `storage` crate provides a working SQLite backend for local, encrypted data persistence (`/tmp/lcore-mvp.db`)Â¹.
- **REST APIs**: The `api` crate exposes `/device/register` and `/device/data` endpoints using the Axum framework.
- **KC-Chain Integration**: The `kc_chain` crate successfully submits transactions to the [`MVPIoTProcessor`](https://github.com/Modern-Society-Labs/lcore-platform) Stylus contract on the live KC-Chain devnet.

### **Phase 2: Cartesi Migration (Milestone 2 - Next)**
With the MVP validated, the project is now ready to proceed with migration to the full Cartesi rollups-node architecture, including:
- **[Cartesi VM Integration](https://github.com/Modern-Society-Labs/lcore-node)**: Migrate SQLite operations to deterministic Cartesi environmentÂ¹
- **RiscZero zkProofs**: Replace SHA256 simulation with cryptographic proof generationÂ¹  
- **Fraud Proof System**: Complete dispute resolution mechanism

Â¹ *These functions will be migrated to the [Cartesi Layer](https://github.com/Modern-Society-Labs/lcore-node) in Milestone 2*

## âœ… MVP Architecture Components

The as-built architecture is a streamlined version of the initial plan, focused on validating the core flow.

```

**Flow Description:**
1.  A `curl` command simulates an IoT device, POSTing data to the `lcore-node-mvp` REST API.
2.  The `DualEncryptionService` performs the two-stage encryption.
3.  The final encrypted payload is stored in the local SQLite database.
4.  A commitment is sent to the [`MVPIoTProcessor`](https://github.com/Modern-Society-Labs/lcore-platform) Stylus contract on KC-Chain. The transaction was successful after implementing a fixed gas limit to handle the calldata size.

## ðŸš€ Key Benefits of MVP Completion

### **Technical Validation**
- Proved the core dual-encryption pipeline works end-to-end.
- Validated direct integration with a live Arbitrum Orbit chain (KC-Chain).
- Confirmed the ABI compatibility between `ethers-rs` and the Stylus contract.

### **Clear Path to Cartesi**
- The MVP's modular, multi-crate architecture (`api`, `encryption`, `storage`, `kc_chain`) provides clear seams for migration. Each component can be swapped with a Cartesi-powered equivalent.
